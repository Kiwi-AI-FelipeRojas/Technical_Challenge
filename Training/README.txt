Computer Vision model training

This folder contains all the necessary code and files to train the computer vision model. First, The folder named "datasets" has all the training and validation files and its corresponding labels. Second, the "dataset.yaml" file, summarizes the organization of training files. Third, the "yolov8n.pt" has all the parameters of the pretrained model. Last, the "Training.ipynb" file contains all the code used to train the model. To run the code the next libraries are required:
	
	- kagglehub
	- ultralytics

When the code is runed, the folder named "runs" is created and saves all the parameters and the results of the best trained model.
